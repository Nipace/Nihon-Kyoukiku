                    <h1 class="theme-color py-3">Short-term Student Exchange Program </h1><hr>
                    <p>
                        Short-term study refers primarily to studying abroad while still enrolled at a university in one’s
                        home country on the basis of inter-university exchange agreements. The objective is not necessarily
                        to obtain a degree but rather acquire a foreign language, experience a foreign culture or study at a
                        university, etc. in a foreign country or region. The student receives education for a semester or
                        several semesters within an academic year, acquiring credits or receives research guidance.
                        Classes are carried out in the language of the country where the educational facility is located or
                        in a foreign language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Student exchange refers to a university dispatching a foreign student to another university with
                        which it has an inter-university exchange agreement and having the other university accept the
                        student.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Credit acquired at the university where the exchange student is studying is generally calculated
                        into the credits earned at the university where the exchange student is originally enrolled.
                        Depending on the number of credits earned, it becomes possible for the student to graduate from
                        the university where he/she is originally enrolled when the standard number of years necessary for
                        acquiring a degree is reached. Tuition is ordinarily paid to the university where the exchange
                        student is originally enrolled. However, there is a need to confirm how tuition should be paid
                        while abroad as an exchange student or how credits are handled as they may differ from university
                        to university.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="theme-color py-1">Procedures for Becoming an Exchange Student</h3><hr>
                    <p>
                        Almost all Japanese universities have an inter-university exchange agreement with a foreign
                        university. Students desiring to become an exchange student at a Japanese university need to select
                        a university from among the Japanese universities with which his/her university has an
                        inter-university exchange agreement. S/he then makes an application for student exchange with the
                        university in which s/he is enrolled. After going through a screening at his/her university, an
                        application is then made to the university s/he wants to study at as an exchange student.
                        This application is made through his/her university. Going abroad to study as an exchange student
                        becomes possible when agreement is obtained from the university that s/he has chosen. Please keep
                        in mind that even if there is an inter-university exchange agreement with the university, not all
                        credits necessarily become object to exchange.
