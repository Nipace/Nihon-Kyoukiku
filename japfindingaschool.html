                    <p>Foreign students can enroll in one of five types of institutions of higher learning: Universities
                        (undergraduate courses), graduate schools, junior colleges, professional training colleges
                        (post-secondary courses) and colleges of technology. Furthermore, various types of Japanese language schools are available for those who want to study Japanese in Japan.
                        Each student may have a different reason for choosing to study in Japan.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Do you want to earn a degree or conduct long-term research?</li>
                        <li>Do you want to acquire proficiency in the Japanese language through study at a Japanese-language institute?</li>
                        <li>Do you want to acquire a certain specialized skill?</li></ol>
                    Think of the above and you should clarify your objective before selecting a school. <br><br>
                    
                    <h3 class="theme-color">1. Universities (Undergraduate)</h3><hr>
                    <p>There are national, public and private universities in Japan. The length of study in an undergraduate
                        university is four years with the exception of medicine, dentistry and veterinary science department,
                        which require six years of study.</p>
                    For information regarding undergraduate courses at specific universities, please refer to the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) web site.<br>

                    The length of study in a graduate school depends on whether you are matriculated in a master's program or doctor's program.<br>
                    Master's program: lasts for two years.<br>
                    <p>Doctor's program: lasts for five years. Generally, the doctor's program is divided into the first period
                        (two years; applicable to the above-mentioned master's program) and the latter period (three years).
                        However, the length of study for the doctor's program in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science
                        (entered upon after completion of the six-year undergraduate courses in medicine, dentistry or veterinary
                        science) is four years. Some universities offer doctor's programs covering the full five years while others
                        offer only the final three years</p>
                    <p>For information regarding specific graduate schools, please refer to the Asian Students Cultural Association web site.

                <p>In order to select a university that is most suitable for achieving your objective,
                    it is extremely important that the prospective student has an accurate understanding of such things
                    as the educational circumstances in Japan as well as the features of the education or research offered
                    by a university. It is also important that you get to know about living in Japan or the available
                    scholarships in advance. One way to collect information related to studying in Japan is through overseas
                    Japanese diplomatic establishments and the Association of International Education, Japan.</p>
