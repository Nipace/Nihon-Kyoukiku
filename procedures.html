                    <p>
                        The immigration procedures for foreign students are based on the Immigration Control and Refugee
                        Recognition Act (“Immigration Control Act”), which stipulates the procedures related to entry and
                        residence in Japan by all foreign nationals and establishes 30 statuses of residence according to
                        the activity the relevant foreign national will be undertaking while in Japan or their position.
                        It also establishes a period of stay (how long the foreign national may reside in Japan) according to
                        status of residence

                    <p>
                        A visa must be acquired in order to study in Japan. There are two ways in which the visa may be acquired.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The foreign student wishing to enter Japan for studies should files an application for a visa
                            directly to an overseas Japanese embassy or consulate.</li>
                        <li>An employee of the educational institution in which the foreign student is scheduled to enroll
                            makes an application to the relevant immigration office, etc. for a Certificate of Eligibility for
                            Residence Status (“Certificate of Eligibility”) on the foreign student’s behalf. Once the
                            Certificate of Eligibility is granted, the foreign student wishing to enter Japan takes his/her
                            Certificate of Eligibility to an overseas Japanese embassy or consulate and files an application
                            for a visa.</li> <br><br>
                        <p>
                            The Certificate of Eligibility provides proof that s/he conforms to the conditions for entry
                            as prescribed in Article 7 Paragraph 1 Item 2 of the Immigration Control Act. Therefore, being in
                            possession of a Certificate of Eligibility will make the procedures for visa issuance at overseas
                            Japanese embassies, etc. as well as the immigration inspection at a Japanese airport go smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The documents necessary for filing an application for a Certificate of Eligibility to the
                            immigration office is described at the <a href="http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/index.html">Immigration Bureau of Japan website</a> . Please note that because
                            the documents required by a Japanese educational institution may differ from school to school, you
                            should consult the school in which you are scheduled to enroll for details.

                    <p>
                        An immigration inspection must be undergone upon arrival at an air or sea port in Japan.
                        A valid passport with valid visa affixed, Certificate of Eligibility (if one has obtained a
                        certificate) and ED card (embarkation and disembarkation card: normally distributed in the plane
                        during flight but also available at the port of arrival) are submitted to the immigration officer and
                        personally identifying data (fingerprints and facial photograph) provided.
                        The matters inspected include the following:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>That the passport and visa are valid</li>
                        <li>That the activities that the foreign national will be engaged in while in
                            Japan as stated in the application are true and falls under one of the status of residence
                            categories described in "1. Status of Residence and Period of Stay " above and conforms to the
                            standards stipulated by ministerial ordinance.</li>
                        <li> That the period of stay requested conforms to the period as established by law</li>
                        <li>That the foreign national does not fall under any of the grounds for denial of disembarkation.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    The immigration inspection for (2) above will be simplified and speedy for those who have obtained a Certificate of Eligibility.
                    <p>
                        Once the foreign national is deemed to conform to aforementioned conditions (1) through (4) above,
                        entry is authorized and a seal of verification for disembarkation is affixed on the passport,
                        either as a sticker or stamp. The disembarkation permit seal contains information such as the status
                        of residence, period of stay and date of expiration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A foreign national granted long-term residency status in his or her disembarkation permission
                        (hereinafter referred to as a “mid- to long-term resident”) will be issued a Resident Card.
                        If the air or sea port that serves as the point of entry is unable to issue a Resident Card,
                        a stamp stating that a Resident Card will be issued later will be placed in the foreign national’s
                        passport and a Resident Card will be issued by mail after filling out a form providing notification
                        of moving into a new domicile (notification of address) at the local city, ward, town or village
                        government office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A foreign national who has received disembarkation permission as a mid- to long-term resident must
                        fill out a form providing notification of moving into a new domicile (notification of address) with

                        visa.

                        Criteria such as “Employment is based on a contract with a Japanese company, etc.
                        (one cannot work on a freelance basis),” “The content of the work utilizes the specialized
                        knowledge gained through university education, etc.,” “The person has an education of a university
                        graduate or higher or has 10 years or more hands-on experience,” and “The salary is equivalent to or
                        higher than that of Japanese nationals” must be met. (Note that residency status is granted based upon a liberal understanding of the connection between the field studied at university and the content of work.)
                        The application for Change of Status of Residence is made at the local immigration office. The fee to
                        apply for Change of Status of Residence is 4,000 yen. (A revenue stamp for the fee is necessary at the
                        time of application.) Materials necessary for applying for a change of residency status from College
                        Student to either Engineer or Specialist in Humanities/International Services vary depending on the
                        size of the employing company. Please refer to the Immigration Bureau’s homepage for details
