                <h2 class="theme-color">The "300000 Foreign Students Plan" Campaign</h2><hr>
                <p>In 2008, the Government of Japan announced the "300000 Foreign Students Plan," which calls to increase the 
                  umber of foreign students in Japan from the 140,000 to 300,000 students by 2020. It is aiming to make a 
                  significant increase in the number of foreign students studying in Japan in the next five years.</p>
                 <p>  We spoke to the officer in charge of the plan at the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and 
                   Technology about the background and objectives of this plan</p>
                <h2 class="theme-color">Interview [Published in 2010] </h2><hr>
                <p>The number of foreign students coming to Japan to study currently numbers approximately 140,000. 
                  As the international movement of students at the level of higher education is expected to increase 
                  even more on a global scale, there has been much discussion carried out in various quarters - using 
                  a variety of concepts and numerical values - on how Japan should go about accepting foreign students since 
                  the 100000 Foreign Students Plan was achieved in 2003</p>
                <p>The "300000 Foreign Students Plan" was announced by former Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda in his Policy 
                  Speech to the 169th Session of the Diet (January 2008) as being important in order to make Japan a country 
                  that is more open to the world and to expand the flow of people to and from Japan</p>
                <p>Regarding "300,000" as being the number of foreign students accepted in Japan, there is a need to consider
                   this by comparing it with several different circumstances, such as the number of foreign students being 
                   accepted by other countries and the current number of foreign students being accepted here in Japan</p>
                <p>It is said that there is currently a total of 3.5 million students enrolled in Japanese institutions of 
                  higher education, such as universities. While the overall number is on a downward trend with the decline 
                  in the Japanese population under age 18, there is an increase, at the same time, in the rate of those 
                  advancing to higher education, etc. For such reasons, it can be assumed that the number of those enrolled 
                  in Japanese institutions of higher education will continue to remain at roughly 3 million in the future.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, if we look at the current state of foreign student enrollment in other countries, we see that 
                  in the case of Germany, a developed non-English-speaking nation like Japan, foreign students account for 
                  12.3% of all students enrolled in an institution of higher education. In France, foreign students account 
                  for 11.9% of all students in an institution of higher education. (Meanwhile, foreign students in an 
                  English-speaking nation account for, in the case of the UK, 25.1% of all students in higher education, and 
                  likewise 26.2% in Australia.)</p>
                <p>If Japanese institutions of higher education are to secure a level of foreign student enrollment similar
                     to that of other developed nations, there is a need to increase the percentage of foreign students from 
                     the current 3 percent-plus to a percentage close to that of Germany or France, or about 10%. (In other 
                     words, 10% of 3 million students, which is roughly equal to 300,000.)</p>
                <p>There is also a report that says the global foreign student market will rapidly expand in the future. 
                    This report estimates that the number of foreign students worldwide will be at about 5 million in 2015, 
                    increasing to 7 million by 2025.</p>
                <p>Foreign students in Japan currently account for about 5% of all foreign students worldwide. If we suppose
                     that the number of all foreign students in 2020, the midway point in the report, is 6 million, then Japan 
                     uld need to accept about 300,000 foreign students in order to maintain its current share</p>
                <p>I think you can see, from these two numerical situations alone, the importance of this number - 300,000 - 
                    as being the target for foreign student acceptance by institutions of higher education in Japan; that is, 
                    if they are to play a role similar to one played by institutions of higher education in other countries</p>
                <p>We believe that proactive acceptance of foreign students, who become a major source of high-level human 
                    resources, by Japanese institutions of higher education, leads not only to the reinforcement of Japan's 
                    international human resource pool but also builds human networks between Japan and other countries, enhances 
                    mutual understanding and fosters greater amicable relationships, and contributes to global stability and 
                    world peace.</p>
                <p>An environment that is further conducive to study in Japan by foreign students is being prepared through 
                  this plan. We hope that even more students from your country will come to Japan to study in the future</p>
